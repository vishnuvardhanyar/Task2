# Task2
This project is the completion of Task 2: Data Visualization & Storytelling for the Data Analyst Internship. Using the Superstore sales dataset, I created multiple visualizations to uncover business insights such as total sales by category, regional performance, profit trends, and monthly sales patterns. The analysis was done using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Each chart was designed with a focus on clarity, storytelling, and business relevance. The visualizations help explain which product categories generate more revenue, how profit varies across segments, and which regions perform the best. This task helped strengthen my skills in data interpretation, dashboard-style reporting, and presenting insights in a clear, visual format. All charts, code files, and the dataset are included in this repository.
